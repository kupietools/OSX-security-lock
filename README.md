# OSX-security-lock
A context-aware BASH script to manage securely locking a OS X user session, designed to be triggered by an environment monitoring utility such as BlueSense or ControlPlane. Options allow a password popup giving a user-defined amount of time to prevent locking, or preventing it from running more than once in a user-specified period of time, to prevent event misfires from driving you crazy while you're trying to work.
